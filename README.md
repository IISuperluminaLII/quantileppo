# QuantilePPO

This repository implements **Quantile Regression**-based reinforcement learning heads and distribution classes, integrated into PPO and World Model architectures.  
It follows the ideas from Dabney et al. for **Distributional RL** and adapts them to continuous and discrete control via PPO.
